codename 1.0 beta
A simple utility to translate an input into all the languages available at once.

NOTE:

    I'm required by the terms of use to link to Yandex Translate.
    As there's no way to do at the moment, at the end of each operation,
    your default web browser will launch and link to http://translate.yandex.com.
    Check OPTIONS down below to change this behavior.

USAGE:

    codename [OPTIONS] [SUBCOMMAND]

OPTIONS:

    -t, --translate
        Translate the input into all languages available.

    -a, --all
        By default, it'll only display presumably readable character, that being latin.
        Using this flag will include everything, latin and non-latin. 

    -b, --browser
        Do not open the browser at the end.
        
    -h, --help
        Show help.
